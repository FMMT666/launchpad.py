launchpad.py
============

A [Novation Launchpad][1] control suite for [Python][2].

If you ever dreamed of using your Launchpad for completely other stuff than music: Welcome !-)

Compatible with most [tm] single board computers.

Watch a 6s video [here][7].  
Or take a look at [that one][8].  
What about the brand new Launchpad Pro support? [Right][9]!

Hey - and the Mac? Yep, that finally works too. [Look][12] \o/  

Upcoming attraction: [Launch Control XL][15].

Oh, don't let us forget the [Dicer][16].

Older Launchpads might be documented [here][10].

    - "Pro" now automatically put in "Ableton Live mode" after opening it.
      No need to push "Setup - Live" button anymore.
    - added Mk2 LedCtrlRawByCode() and LedCtrlXYByCode()
    - added Pro ButtonStateRaw(); first *damn fast* button reads \o/

### CHANGES 2016/01/10:

    - The current version does not work with Mac OS X.
      Regarding that, as well as the fact that PyGame somehow reached its
      end of life, I am currently looking for other Midi libraries or implementations.
    - I bought a Launchpad Pro. Time to implement this, although I am not sure
      what will come first, building a new Midi system or implementing the Pro.

### CHANGES 2015/02/21:

    - Support for multiple Launchpads now finally built in. Use 'em all:
        lp1 = launchpad.Launchpad()
        lp2 = launchpad.Launchpad()
        lp1.Open(0)
        lp2.Open(1)

### CHANGES 2015/02/18:
  
    - Added option to select a Launchpad if more than one is attached.
      Also supports search for a device string, e.g. "Mini".
    - Added optional parameters <number> and <name> to Open()

## Installation/Usage

### Install as Python package

#### Via pip

Simply execute

    pip install launchpad_py

or

    sudo pip install launchpad_py

(in case you need superuser rights) to install it.  
Notice that the required dependencies (see below) are not automatically resolved.  

You need to install `python-rtmidi` separately:

    pip install python-rtmidi

or

    sudo pip install python-rtmidi


#### From local file system

If you downloaded the Launchpad.py source package, simply execute the command

      python setup.py install

from the base directory or 

      sudo python setup.py install

if superuser access is required.

Load and use the module with

      import launchpad_py
      ...
      ...
      # Mk1 Launchpad:
      lp = launchpad_py.Launchpad()
      # Mk2 Launchpad:
      lp = launchpad_py.LaunchpadMk2()
      # Pro Launchpad:
      lp = launchpad_py.LaunchpadPro()
      # Control XL:
      lp = launchpad_py.LaunchControlXL()
      # LaunchKey Mini:
      lp = launchpad_py.LaunchKeyMini()
      # Dicer:
      lp = launchpad_py.Dicer()

or if you dislike typing that much, use

      import launchpad_py as lppy
      ...
      ...
      lp = lppy.Launchpad()
      lp = lppy.LaunchpadMk2()
      lp = lppy.LaunchpadPro()
      lp = lppy.LaunchControlXL()
      lp = lppy.LaunchKeyMini()
      lp = lppy.Dicer()

For compatibility with existing code, use

      import launchpad_py as launchpad

#### Install directly from Github

Instead of downloading the source distribution, you can directly install it from Github
by executing

      pip2 install git+https://github.com/FMMT666/launchpad.py


### Direct usage

If you don't want to or cannot install the package on your system, simply
copy the two files

      launchpad.py
      charset.py

to your working directory.  
Use those files as described above, but without the "_py":

      import launchpad
      ...
      ...
      # Mk1 Launchpad:
      lp = launchpad.Launchpad()
      ...

or

      import launchpad as LP
      ...
      ...
      lp = LP.Launchpad()
      ...

### Universal loading template code

#### Checks for an installed version first, loads local one as the last resort

      import sys
      
      try:
        import launchpad_py as launchpad
      except ImportError:
        try:
          import launchpad
        except ImportError:
          sys.exit("error loading lauchpad.py")

#### Checks for a local version first (file in same folder), uses the installed one secondary

      import sys
      
      try:
        import launchpad as launchpad
      except ImportError:
        try:
          import launchpad_py
        except ImportError:
          sys.exit("error loading lauchpad.py")

## Requirements

  - [Python][2] 2
  - [Pygame][3] v1.9.1, (v1.9.2), v1.9.3

Some Pygame versions do not work on some OSes (e.g. v1.9.2 might cause trouble
with Windows 7/10). I cannot tell you any more than just "try them!".  
The latest fixes (4/2017) were tested with v1.9.3 (via pip from Python 2.7.13)
and Windows 10 (x64). That seems to work fine again...
  
It does not work with Python 3.  

Launchpad.py was tested under

  - Linux, 32 bit, 64 bit
  - Windows XP, 32 bit
  - Windows 7, 32 bit, 64 bit
  - Windows 10, 64 bit
  - macOS Sierra
  - [Raspberry-Pi 1/2][4] (Look out for my [Minecraft][5] controller here: [www.askrprojects.net][6])
  - Beagle Bone (Black)
  - Banana Pi (Pro/M2/R1)
  - pcDuino V3
  - ...

Supported and tested red/green LED Launchpad devices, here referred  to as "Classic" or "Mk1":

  - Launchpad (the original, old "Mk1")
  - Launchpad S
  - Launchpad Mini (Mk1)

Supported and tested full RGB Launchpad devices:
  
  - Launchpad Pro
  - Launchpad Mk2

Supported completely different stuff:

  - Launch Control XL
  - LaunchKey (Mini)
  - Dicer

Notice that Novation now (1/2016) sells an RGB Launchpad under the same
name it once shipped the first red/green LED with!

## Random Notes

### Button, value and potentiometer polling

 Until now (6/2017), Launchpad.py does not have an event system built in. You need to poll the buttons' or
 potentiometer's values manually.  
 Notice that actually nothing will get lost, but every event you create will be buffered (until you run out
 or memory :). If you don't poll the buttons or potentiometers regulary, your might end up with thousands
 of old states and values, blocking the current input.  
 Especially rotating a potentiometer or pushing a slider, creates an event for each single value that
 was sampled. This can easily be hundreds of messages in a few seconds.

 So either poll regulary or use the ButtonFlush()/InputFlush() method to clear everything.

 Also notice that the buffer might be filled right after you started your application...
  

### For Launchpad Mk1 users (the original "Classic" Launchpad):

      USE CLASS "Launchpad":
      
        lp = launchpad.Launchpad()

### For Launchpad Pro users

      USE CLASS "LaunchpadPro":
      
        lp = launchpad.LaunchpadPro()
        
      As of 2016/01/24, the "Pro" is now automatically set to "Ableton Live mode",
      which is required for launchpad.py to work.

### For Launchpad Mk2 users

      USE CLASS "LaunchpadMk2":
      
        lp = launchpad.LaunchpadMk2()

### For Launch Control XL users

      USE CLASS "LaunchControlXL":
      
        lp = launchpad.LaunchControlXL()

### For LaunchKey (Mini) users

Even it is named "Mini", it also supports most of the bigger keyboards' functionalities.  
Notice that some of the button and key numbers collide and cannot be differed.

      USE CLASS "LaunchKeyMini":
      
        lp = launchpad.LaunchKeyMini()

### For Dicer users

The Dicer uses "page" mode by default. The three small buttons "cue", "loop" and "auto loop"
select six different pages (per Dicer module) and each of those can be handled independently.

The first set of the six mode is enabled by simply pushing (and releasing) on of the three mode
buttons, the second set, "shift-mode" is activated by holding down one of the mode buttons while
pushing a number button.

So, if the "cue" page is active and you try to activate an LED in the "loop" page, that
will not be visible until you activate that page.


### For Mac users

#### Mac Python and Pygame

Good news, everybody. It now works with macOS Sierra \o/  
Best part: It even works with the stock "Apple Python".
      
Pygame can be installed via "pip". Just enter "pip" on the console
to see whether it is installed:
      
        pip
      
If it isn't, you can install it with:
      
        sudo easy_install pip
        
If pip is working, search for Pygame via pip (console command):
      
        sudo pip search pygame
      
Somewhere in the list, you should see something like
      
        Pygame (1.9.2b8)   - Python Game Development
        
Install that with:
      
        sudo pip install pygame

#### Hardware

Notice that the original Launchpad Mk1 requires an USB driver. Thanks, [Stewart!][13].  
Get it from [here][14] (Novation USB Driver-2.7.dmg).

As it seems, all newer Launchpads work right out of the box, no driver required.

### For Windows users

      MIDI implementation in PyGame 1.9.2+ is broken and running this might
      bring up an 'insufficient memory' error ( pygame.midi.Input() ).

      SOLUTION: use v1.9.1 (or try v1.9.3)

### For Linux and especially Raspberry-Pi users:

      Due to some bugs in PyGame's MIDI implementation, the buttons of the Launchpad Mk1
      won't work after you restarted a program (LEDs are not affected).

      WORKAROUND #2: Simply hit one of the AUTOMAP keys (the topmost 8 buttons).
                     For whatever reason, this makes the MIDI button events
                     appearing again...

      WORKAROUND #1: Pull the Launchpad's plug out and restart... (annoying).

### Other Notes

#### Launchpad (Pro) not recognized, playing fireworks demo

Just discovered another oddity...

I attached a Launchpad Pro to my Linux box, as many times before, to finally add the
button methods, but it refused to show up as an USB device. Instead of the "note mode",
indicated by a turquoise/pink colour pattern, it played that "fireworks animation" and
did nothing...

The first time I discovered that, I blamed it on an attached FTDI UART chip, but as it
turned out, that was not the reason it didn't work.

It "simply" was a power issue.

So, if your Launchpad Pro shows that firework demo, check your USB cable!  
Seriously. That thing draws a lot of current and most USB cables simply
do not conform to the USB standard.

Mine "looked quite good" from the outside.  
With its ~5.5mm diameter, I assumed it had AWG 22 (~60mOhm/m) or better, but it in fact
has ~drumroll~ AWG 28 (~240mOhm/m) and two thick plastic strings to fill the gaps.

Well, we all know that companies try to save money wherever they can, but that's just
fraud...

Btw, the fireworks demo will play whenever the Launchpad cannot be enumerated (configured).

## Detailed description of common Launchpad methods

### Open( [number], [name], [template (1)] )

    Opens the a Launchpad and initializes it.  
    Please notice that some devices have up to six MIDI entries!.
    
    (1) Notice that <template> is only valid for the Launch Control XL pad.
    A number of 1..8 selects and activates a user template (1 by default)
    or 9..16 a factory one.
    This corresponds to holding down one of the "Template buttons" and
    selecting the template number via the bottom button row.
    
    A dump by ListAll(), with a "Pro", a Mk1 "Mini" and a "Mk2" might look like:
    
        ('ALSA', 'Midi Through Port-0', 0, 1, 0)
        ('ALSA', 'Midi Through Port-0', 1, 0, 0)
        ('ALSA', 'Launchpad Pro MIDI 1', 0, 1, 1)
        ('ALSA', 'Launchpad Pro MIDI 1', 1, 0, 1)
        ('ALSA', 'Launchpad Pro MIDI 2', 0, 1, 0)
        ('ALSA', 'Launchpad Pro MIDI 2', 1, 0, 0)
        ('ALSA', 'Launchpad Pro MIDI 3', 0, 1, 0)
        ('ALSA', 'Launchpad Pro MIDI 3', 1, 0, 0)
        ('ALSA', 'Launchpad Mini MIDI 1', 0, 1, 0)
        ('ALSA', 'Launchpad Mini MIDI 1', 1, 0, 0)
        ('ALSA', 'Launchpad MK2 MIDI 1', 0, 1, 0)
        ('ALSA', 'Launchpad MK2 MIDI 1', 1, 0, 0)
        ('ALSA', 'Launch Control XL MIDI 1', 0, 1, 1)
        ('ALSA', 'Launch Control XL MIDI 1', 1, 0, 1)
    
    You'll only need to count the entries if you have two or more identical Launchpads attached.
    
      PARAMS: <number>   OPTIONAL, number of Launchpad to open.
                         1st device = 0, 2nd device = 1, ...
                         Defaults to 0, the 1st device, if not given.
              <name>     OPTIONAL, only consider devices whose names contain
                         the string <name>. The default names for the classes are:
                           Launchpad()       -> "Launchpad"
                           LaunchpadMk2()    -> "Mk2"
                           LaunchpadPro()    -> "Pro"
                           LaunchControlXL() -> "Control XL"
                           LaunchKeyMini()   -> "Launchkey" (should work for all variants)
                         It is sufficient to search for a part of the string, e.g.
                         "chpad S" will find a device named "Launchpad S" or even
                         "Novation Launchpad S"
              <template> OPTIONAL, ONLY CONTROL XL
                         The Launch Control XL supports eight user and eight factory settings,
                         selectable via the two "Template" burrons on the top right.
                         By default, Launchpad.py uses the template "User 1".
                         1.. 8 -> select user template    1..8
                         9..16 -> select factory template 1..8

      RETURN: True     success
              False    error

	As of 12/2016, the name search patterns are case insensitive, hence strings like "mk2", "pRo"
	or even "lAunCHpAd MiNI" are valid too.

    Notice that the default name for the class Launchpad(), the "Mk1" or "Classic" Launchpads,
    will also react to an attached "Pro" or "Mk2" model. In that case, it's required to either
    enter the complete name (as shown by "ListAll()").


      EXAMPLES:
              # Open the first device attached:
              lp.Open()
              
              # Open the 2nd Launchpad:
              lp.Open( 1 )
              
              # Open the 3rd Launchpad Mini:
              lp.Open( 2, "Launchpad Mini")
              
              # alternative:
              lp.Open( name = "Launchpad Mini", number = 0)
              
              # open the 1st "Mk2"
              lp = launchpad.LaunchpadMk2()    # notice the "Mk2" class!
              lp.Open()                        # equals Open( 0, "Mk2" )
              
              # open the 1st "Pro"
              lp = launchpad.LaunchpadPro()    # notice the "Pro" class!
              lp.Open()                        # equals Open( 0, "Pro" )
              
              # open the 1st "XL" with user template 3
              lp = launchpad.LaunchControlXL( template = 3 )
              lp.Open()
              
              # open the 1st "XL" with factory template 2
              lp = launchpad.LaunchControlXL( template = 10 )
              lp.Open()



### Check( [number], [name] )

    Checks if a device is attached.
    Uses exactly the same notation as Open(), but only returns True or False,
    without opening anything.
    
    Like Open(), this method uses different default names for the different classes:
      Launchpad()        -> "Launchpad"
      LaunchpadMk2()     -> "Mk2"
      LaunchpadPro()     -> "Pro"
      LaunchControlXL()  -> "Control XL"
      LaunchKeyMini()    -> "Launchkey"
      
    Notice that it's absolutely safe to query for an "Pro" or "Mk2" from all classes, e.g.:
    
      lp = lauchpad.Launchpad()        # Launchpad "Mk1" or "Classic" class
      if lp.Check( 0, "Pro" ):         # check for "Pro"
        lp = launchpad.LaunchpadPro()  # "reload" the new class for the "Pro"
        lp.Open()                      # equals lp.Open( 0, "Pro" )
    
    Search patterns are case insensitive.  
    
      PARAMS: see Open()
      
      RETURN: True     device exists
              False    device does not exist


### Close()

    Bug in PyGame. Don't call it (yet)...

      PARAMS:
      RETURN:


### ButtonFlush()

    Flushes the Launchpads button buffer.
    If you do not poll the buttons frequently or even if your software is not running,
    the Launchpad will store each button event in its buffer.
    This function can be used to clear all button events.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN:


### ListAll()

    Debug function.
    Can be called any time and does not even require Open().
    Prints a list of all detected MIDI devices and addresses.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN:


### EventRaw()

    Debug function.
    Returns an unprocessed list of all MIDI events.


      PARAMS:
      RETURN: []  an empty list if nothing happened or this MIDI message:
              [[[ <cmd>, <data1>, <data2>, <res> ], <timestamp> ]]

### Reset()

    Resets the Launchpad and (quickly) turns off all LEDs.
    Notice that only the Mk1 performs a 

      PARAMS:
      RETURN:


### LedGetColor( red, green )

    Returns a the special Launchpad color coding format, calculated
    from a red and green intensity value.

      PARAMS: <red>    red   LED intensity 0..3
              <green>  green LED intensity 0..3
      RETURN: number   Launchpad color code


### LedCtrlRaw( number, red, green )

    Controls an LED via its number (see table somewhere below)

      PARAMS: <number> number of the LED to control
              <red>    red   LED intensity 0..3
              <green>  green LED intensity 0..3
      RETURN:


### LedCtrlXY( x, y, red, green )

    Controls an LED via its coordinates.

      PARAMS: <x>      x coordinate of the LED to control
              <y>      y coordinate of the LED to control
              <red>    red   LED intensity 0..3
              <green>  green LED intensity 0..3
      RETURN:


### LedCtrlRawRapid( allLeds )

    Sends a list of consecutive, special color values to the Launchpad.
    Requires (less than) half of the commands to update all buttons:
    [ LED1, LED2, LED3, ... LED80 ]
    First, the 8x8 matrix is updated, left to right, top to bottom.
    Afterwards, the algorithm continues with the rightmost buttons and
    the top "automap" buttons.

    LEDn color format: 00gg00rr <- 2 bits green, 2 bits red (0..3)
    Function LedGetColor() will do the coding for you...

    Notice that the amount of LEDs needs to be even.
    If an odd number of values is sent, the next, following LED is
    turned off!

      PARAMS: <allLeds> A list of up to 80 Launchpad color codes.
      RETURN:


### LedCtrlAutomap( number, red, green )

    Control one of the "automap" buttons (top row).
    Legacy function, provided for compatibility.

      PARAMS: <number> number of the LED to control
              <red>    red   LED intensity 0..3
              <green>  green LED intensity 0..3

### LedAllOn()

    Turns on all LEDs.

      PARAMS: 
      RETURN:


### LedCtrlChar( char, red, green, offsx = 0, offsy = 0 )

    Sends character <char> in colors <red/green> (0..3 each) and
    lateral offset <offsx> (-8..8) to the Launchpad.
    <offsy> does not have yet any function.
    
    It is highly recommended to use <offsx> and <offsy> as
    named parameters, for compatible code with the RGB Launchpads, e.g.:
    
      lp.LedCtrlChar( 'a', 3, 2, offsx = xvar )

      PARAMS: <char>   one field string to display; e.g.: 'A'
              <red>    red   LED intensity 0..3
              <green>  green LED intensity 0..3
              <offsx>  x offset of the character on the main, 8x8 matrix (-8..8)
                       Negative is left and positive right.
              <offsy>  no function
      RETURN:

      EXAMPLES:
              # scroll a red 'A' from left to right
              for x in range( -8, 9 ):
                lp.LedCtrlChar( 'A', 3, 0, offsx = x )
                time.wait( 100 )


### LedCtrlString( string, red, green, direction = 0, waitms = 150 )

    Scrolls <string> across the Launchpad's main, 8x8 matrix.
    <red/green> specify the color and intensity (0..3 each).
    <direction> determines the direction of scrolling.
    Dirty hack: <waitms>, by default 150, delays the scrolling speed.
    
    WARNING:
    Too short times will overflow the Launchpad's buffer and mess up
    the screen.
    
    For future compatibility, it is highly recommended to use
    <direction> and <waitms> as a named arguments, e.g.:
    
      lp.LedCtrlString( "Hello", 3,1, direction = -1, waitms = 100 )


      PARAMS: <string>     a string to display; e.g.: 'Hello'
              <red>        red   LED intensity 0..3
              <green>      green LED intensity 0..3
              <direction> -1 -> scroll right to left
                           0 -> do not scroll, just show the character
                           1 -> scroll left to right
              <waitms>     OPTIONAL: delay for scrolling speed, default 150
      RETURN:


### ButtonChanged()

    Returns True if a button event occured. False otherwise.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN: True/False


### ButtonStateRaw()

    Returns the state of the buttons in RAW mode.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN: [ ]                        An empty list if no event occured, otherwise...
              [ <button>, <True/False> ] ... a list with two fields:
              <button> is the RAW button number, the second field determines
              if the button was pressed <True> or released <False>.


### ButtonStateXY()

    Returns the state of buttons in X/Y mode.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN: [ ]                        An empty list if no event occured, otherwise...
              [ <x>, <y>, <True/False> ] ... a list with three fields:
              <x> is the x coordinate of the button, <y>, guess what, the
              y coordinate. The third field reveals if the button was pressed
              <True> or released <False>.

## Detailed description of Launchpad "Pro" or "Mk2" only methods

### LedSetMode( mode ) *>>> PRO ONLY <<<*

    Sets the Launchpad's mode.
    For proper operation with launchpad.py, the "Pro" must be set to "Ableton Live" mode.
    There is no need to call this method as it is automatically executed within Open().

      PARAMS: <mode>   0 selects "Ableton Live mode" (what we need)
                       1 selects "Standalone mode"   (power-up default)
      RETURN:


### LedGetColorByName( name )

    WORK IN PROGRESS! ONLY A FEW COLORS, SO FAR!

    Returns a color in the special Launchpad Pro color code format, derived
    from a color name, in the string <name>.
    [...]

      PARAMS: <name>   a name of a color in lower caps, "red", "green"...
      RETURN: number   Launchpad Pro color code

      EXAMPLES:
              colorRed = LP.LedGetColorByName( "red" )
    
    Supported, so far:
      off, black, white, red, green


### LedCtrlRaw( number, red, green, [blue] )

    +++ NOTICE:
    +++   It is recommended to always call this with a "blue" parameter.
    +++   The compatibility mode will be removed soon. 
    
    Controls an LED via its number and red, green and blue intensity values.
    
    This method uses system-exclusive MIDI messages, which require 10 bytes to
    be sent for each message. For a faster version, hence less comfortable version,
    see LedCtrlRawByCode() below (though even sending 10 bytes is pretty fast on the Pro).
    
    If <blue> is omitted, this method runs in "Mk1" compatibility mode, which only
    had red/green LEDs and intensities ranging from 0..3. In that mode, the input
    arguments are multiplied by 21, to map 0..3 to 0..63.
    
    Notice that the "Pro" and "Mk2" have different LED number layouts.
    Please see tables, somewhere below.

      PARAMS: <number>    number of the LED to control
              <red>       a number from 0..63
              <green>     a number from 0..63
              <blue>      OPTIONAL, a number from 0..63
      RETURN:


### LedCtrlRawByCode( number, [colorcode] )

    Controls an LED via its number and colorcode.
    If <colorcode> is omitted, 'white' is used.
    This is about three times faster than the comfortable RGB method LedCtrlRaw().

      PARAMS: <number>     number of the LED to control
              <colorcode>  OPTIONAL, a number from 0..127
      RETURN:


### LedCtrlXY( x, y, red, green, [blue], [mode] )

    +++ NOTICE:
    +++   It is recommended to always call this with a "blue" parameter.
    +++   The compatibility mode will be removed soon. 
    
    Controls an LED via its x/y coordinates and red, green or blue intensity values.
    An additional <mode> parameter determines the origin of the x-axis.
    
    If <blue> is omitted, this method operates in "Mk1" compatibility mode.
    The Mk1 Launchpad only had 2 bit intensity values (0..3). In compatibility
    mode, these values are now multiplied by 21, to extend the range to 0..63.
    That way, old, existing code, written for the classic Launchpads does not
    need to be changed.
    
    For "Pro" only:
      By default, if <mode> is omitted, the origin of the x axis is the left side
      of the 8x8 matrix, like in the "Mk1" mode (those devices had no round buttons
      on the left).
      If <mode> is set to "pro" (string), x=0 will light up the round buttons on the
      left side. Please also see the table for X/Y modes somewhere at the end of this
      document.

    This method uses system-exclusive MIDI messages, which require 10 bytes to
    be sent for each message. For a faster version, hence less comfortable version,
    see LedCtrlXYByCode() below.
    
      PARAMS: <x>      x coordinate of the LED to control
              <y>      y coordinate of the LED to control
              <red>    red   LED intensity 0..63 (or 0..3 in "Mk1" mode)
              <green>  green LED intensity 0..63 (or 0..3 in "Mk1" mode)
              <blue>   blue  LED intensity 0..63 (omit  for  "Mk1" mode)
              <mode>   OPTIONAL: "pro" selects new x/y origin >>> PRO ONLY <<<
      RETURN:


### LedCtrlXYByCode( x, y, colorcode, [mode] )

    Controls an LED via its x/y coordinates and a color from the color palette.
    
    Except for the color code, this function does the same as LedCtrlXY() does,
    but about 3 times faster.
    
      PARAMS: <x>          x coordinate of the LED to control
              <y>          y coordinate of the LED to control
              <colorcode>  a number from 0..127
              <mode>       OPTIONAL: "pro" selects new x/y origin >>> PRO ONLY <<<
      RETURN:


### LedCtrlXYByRGB( x, y, colorlist, [mode] )

    Controls an LED via its x/y coordinates and a list of colors in RGB format.
    
    This function does the same as LedCtrlXY() does, except that the color information
    is now passed in as list [R,G,B].
    
      PARAMS: <x>          x coordinate of the LED to control
              <y>          y coordinate of the LED to control
              <colorlist>  a list with [ R, G, B ] color codes; each from 0..63
              <mode>       OPTIONAL: "pro" selects new x/y origin >>> PRO ONLY <<<
      RETURN:
      
      EXAMPLES:
              LP.LedCtrlXYByRGB( 3, 7, [63, 42, 0] )


### LedCtrlChar( char, red, green, [blue], offsx = 0, offsy = 0 )

    +++ NOTICE:
    +++   It is recommended to always call this with a "blue" parameter.
    +++   The compatibility mode will be removed soon.
    
    Sends character <char> in colors <red/green/blue> (0..63 each) and
    lateral offset <offsx> (-8..8) to the Launchpad.
    <offsy> does not have yet any function.
    
    It is highly recommended to use <offsx> and <offsy> as
    named parameters, for compatible code with the RGB Launchpads, e.g.:
    
      lp.LedCtrlChar( 'a', 3, 2, offsx = xvar )
      
    If <blue> is ommited, this methods runs in "Mk1" compatibility
    mode and multiplies the <red> and <green> intensity values with 21, to
    adapt the old 0..3 range to the new 0..63 one of the "Pro" mode.
    That way, it is compatible to old, existing "Mk1" code.

      PARAMS: <char>   one field string to display; e.g.: 'A'
              <red>    red   LED intensity 0..63 (or 0..3 in "Mk1" mode)
              <green>  green LED intensity 0..63 (or 0..3 in "Mk1" mode)
              <blue>   blue  LED intensity 0..63 (omit  for  "Mk1" mode)
              <offsx>  x offset of the character on the main, 8x8 matrix (-8..8)
                       Negative is left and positive right.
              <offsy>  no function
      RETURN:

      EXAMPLES:
              # scroll a purple 'A' from left to right
              for x in range( -8, 9 ):
                lp.LedCtrlChar( 'A', 63, 0, 63, offsx = x )
                time.wait( 100 )


### LedCtrlString( string, red, green, [blue], direction = 0, waitms = 150 )

    +++ NOTICE:
    +++   It is recommended to always call this with a "blue" parameter.
    +++   The compatibility mode will be removed soon (and the output on
    +++   Mk2 and Pro pads might be messed up).
    
    Notice that the Launchpad Pro has string scrolling capabilities built in, but
    this function provides the old, Mk1 compatible functionality. Advantages
    are custom fonts and symbols (in the future).

    Scrolls a string <str> across the Launchpad's main, 8x8 matrix.
    <red/green/blue> specify the color and intensity (0..63 each).
    <direction> determines the direction of scrolling.
    Dirty hack: <waitms>, by default 150, delays the scrolling speed.
    
    If <blue> is omitted, "Mk1" compatibility mode is turned on and the old
    0..3 <red/green> intensity values are strechted to 0..63.
    
    For future compatibility, it is highly recommended to use
    <direction> and <waitms> as a named arguments, e.g.:
    
      lp.LedCtrlString( "Hello", 3,1, direction = -1, waitms = 100 )


      PARAMS: <string>     a string to display; e.g.: 'Hello'
              <red>        red   LED intensity 0..63 (or 0..3 in "Mk1" mode)
              <green>      green LED intensity 0..63 (or 0..3 in "Mk1" mode)
              <blue>       green LED intensity 0..63 (omit  for  "Mk1" mode)
              <direction> -1 -> scroll right to left
                           0 -> do not scroll, just show the character
                           1 -> scroll left to right
              <waitms>     OPTIONAL: delay for scrolling speed, default 150
      RETURN:


### LedAllOn( [colorcode] )

    Quickly sets all LEDs to the color code given by <colorcode>.
    If <colorcode> is omitted, 'white' is used.

      PARAMS: <colorcode>   OPTIONAL, a number from 0..127
      RETURN:


### ButtonStateRaw()

    Returns the state of the buttons in RAW mode.
    
    Notice that this is not directly compatible with the "Mk1" ButtonStateRaw()
    method, which returns [ <button>, <True/False> ].

      PARAMS:
      RETURN: [ ]                    An empty list if no event occured, otherwise...
              [ <button>, <value> ]  ... a list with two fields:
              <button> is the button number, the second field, <value> determines
              the intensity (0..127) with which the button was pressed.
              0 means that the button was released.


### ButtonStateXY( [mode] )

    Returns the state of the buttons in X/Y mode.
    
    Notice that this is not directly compatible with the "Mk1" ButtonStateRaw()
    method, which returns [ <button>, <True/False> ].

      PARAMS: <mode>       OPTIONAL: "pro" selects new x/y origin >>> PRO ONLY <<<
      RETURN: [ ]                    An empty list if no event occured, otherwise...
              [ <x>, <y>, <value> ]  ... a list with three fields:
              <x> and <y> are the button's coordinates. The third field, <value> determines
              the intensity (0..127) with which the button was pressed.
              0 means that the button was released.
              Notice that "Mk2" Pads will only return either 0 or 127.
              They don't have the full analog mode like the "Pro" has.

              <red>    red   LED intensity 0..3
              <green>  green LED intensity 0..3
      RETURN:


### LedCtrlXY( x, y, red, green )

    Controls an LED via its coordinates.

      PARAMS: <x>      x coordinate of the LED to control
              <y>      y coordinate of the LED to control
              <red>    red   LED intensity 0..3
              <green>  green LED intensity 0..3
      RETURN:


### InputChanged()

    Returns True if a button or potentiometer event occured. False otherwise.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN: True/False


### InputFlush()

    Flushes the Launch Control XL's input buffer.
    If you do not poll the buttons or potentiometer values frequently or even if your software
    is not running, the Launch Control XL will store each event in its buffer.
    This function can be used to clear all button and potentiometer events.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN:


### InputStateRaw()

    Returns the state of the buttons or the value of the last potentiometer change in RAW mode.

    In case the last event was caused by a button being pressed or released, this function
    returns the button number and either "True" or "False" or if a potentiometer was rotated
    or a slider moved, its value (0..127).

    Notice that this is different from other's Launchpad "ButtonStateRaw()" methods, as it
    forces you to check whether the 2nd field is a number or a boolean value.

    Notice that the Control XL buttons do not support an analog velocity value.
    For compatibility, either "0" or "127" are returned in the third list field, corresponding
    to "False" (0) or "True" (127).
  
      PARAMS:
      RETURN: [ ]                               An empty list if no event occured, otherwise either
              [ <button>, <True/False>, 0/127 ] the button number, True or False and the velocity
              [ <potnum>, <value>     , 0     ] the potentiometer number and its value 0..127
              <button> and <potnum> are the RAW button or potentiometer numbers, the second field
              either determines the state of the button ("True" if pressed, "False" if released) or
              returns the value of the potentiometer that was changed.
              
      EXAMPLES:
      
        xlEvent = lp.InputStateRaw()
        if xlEvent != []:
          if xlEvent[1] is True or xlEvent[1] is False:
            print( "Button        ", xlEvent[0], xlEvent[1] )
          else:
            print( "Potentiometer ", xlEvent[0], xlEvent[1] )

### InputChanged()

    Returns True if a button, key or potentiometer event occured. False otherwise.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN: True/False


### InputFlush()

    Flushes the buffer of the LaunchKey (Mini)'s.
    If you do not poll the buttons, keys or potentiometer values frequently or even if your software
    is not running, the Launch Control XL will store each event in its buffer.
    This function can be used to clear all button and potentiometer events.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN:


### InputStateRaw()

    Returns the state of the buttons, keys or the value of the last potentiometer change in RAW mode.

    In case the last event was caused by a button being pressed or released, this function
    returns the button number and either "True" or "False" or if a potentiometer was rotated
    or a slider moved, its value (0..127).

    Notice that this is different from other's Launchpad "ButtonStateRaw()" methods, as it
    forces you to check whether the 2nd field is a number or a boolean value.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN: [ ]                                    An empty list if no event occured, otherwise either
              [ <button>, <True/False>, <velocity> ] the button number, True or False and the velocity
              [ <key>,    <True/False>, <velocity> ] the key number and its velocity 0..127
              [ <potnum>, <value>     , 0          ] the potentiometer number and its value 0..127
              <button>, <key> and <potnum> are the RAW button, key or potentiometer numbers, the second
              field either determines the state of the button or key ("True" if pressed, "False" if released)
              or returns the value of the potentiometer that was changed.
              
      EXAMPLES:
      
        lkEvent = lp.InputStateRaw()
        if lkEvent != []:
          if lkEvent[1] is True or lkEvent[1] is False:

## Detailed description of Dicer specific methods


### Reset()

    Resets the Dicer, (quickly) turns off all LEDs and restores the power-on defaults.
    Notice that an enabled light show will *not* be stopped.

      PARAMS:
      RETURN:


### ModeSet( device, mode )

    Enables on of the seven modes (or button and LED "pages") of the Dicer:
    
      0  cue
      1  cue + shift
      2  loop
      3  loop + shift
      4  auto loop 
      5  auto loop + shift
      6  one page mode
      
    See ButtonStateRaw(), LedCtrlRaw() or the Dicer's button and LED table at the end of this
    document to see how mode 0..5 work.
    
    If the "one page mode" is enabled, the mode buttons themselves do not select a bank anymore,
    but return a value instead.
    
      PARAMS: <device>     0 = master, 1 = slave
              <mode>       0..6 as specifies above
      RETURN:


### ButtonStateRaw()

    Returns the state of the buttons in (an already nicely mapped :) RAW mode.
    The returned numbers of the buttons equal the labels on the Dicer's buttons, with
    the following extension (also see the LED/button mapping ASCII drawing somewhere below):
    
    The three mode buttons "cue", "loop" and "auto loop" act as a modifier and add the following
    numbers to the button value.
    For "shift" operation, continue to hold down one of the three mode buttons while pressing a number.
    
      Master, "cue":        01 ..  05  +shift:  06 ..  10
      Master, "loop":       11 ..  15  +shift:  16 ..  20
      Master, "auto loop":  21 ..  25  +shift:  26 ..  30
    
      Slave,  "cue":       101 .. 105  +shift: 106 .. 110
      Slave,  "loop:       111 .. 115  +shift: 116 .. 120
      Slave,  "auto loop": 121 .. 115  +shift: 126 .. 130
      
    In "one page mode", the mode buttons do not have a special function but return a value upon being pressed:
    
      Master, "cue":         6
      Master, "loop":        7
      Master, "auto loop":   8

      Slave,  "cue":       106
      Slave,  "loop:       107
      Slave,  "auto loop": 108
    
    The mode can either be set by pushing/holding down the corresponding buttons
    or via ModeSet( <device>, <mode> ).
    
      PARAMS:
      RETURN: [ ]                                 An empty list if no event occured, otherwise
              [ <button>, <True/False>, <0/127> ] the button number, True or False and the velocity (only 0 or 127).
              


### LedSetLightshow( device, enable )

    Enables or disables the built-in LED light show of the Dicer.
    Notice that the dicer will do nothing (else) during the light show.

      PARAMS: <device>    0 selects master, 1 selects slave
              <enable>    True turns the light show on, False off
      RETURN:


### LedCtrlRaw( number, hue, intensity )

    Control an LED via its number, a hue and intensity information.
    The number of the LED to control corresponds to the button's labels 1..5,
    with the following modifiers:

      Master, "cue":        01 ..  05  +shift:  06 ..  10
      Master, "loop":       11 ..  15  +shift:  16 ..  20
      Master, "auto loop":  21 ..  25  +shift:  26 ..  30
    
      Slave,  "cue":       101 .. 105  +shift: 106 .. 110
      Slave,  "loop:       111 .. 115  +shift: 116 .. 120
      Slave,  "auto loop": 121 .. 115  +shift: 126 .. 130

    In "one page mode", the mode LEDs can be controlled via:
    
      Master, "cue":         6
      Master, "loop":        7
      Master, "auto loop":   8

      Slave,  "cue":       106
      Slave,  "loop:       107
      Slave,  "auto loop": 108

    The mode can either be set by pushing/holding down the corresponding buttons
    or via ModeSet( <device>, <mode> ).
    
    The color shade can be controlled with <hue>, avalue from 0..7:
    
      0  red
      1  red-orange
      2  orange
      3  orange-amber
      4  amber
      5  yellow
      6  yellow-green
      7  green

    I just leave that as it is. Complaints can be sent to Novation :'-)
        
    
      PARAMS: <number>     number of the LED (see Dicer mapping table somewhere below)
              <hue>        0..7 hue value (see text above)
              <intensity>  LED intensity value 0..15
      RETURN:


### LedAllOff()

    Quickly turns off all LEDs on all Dicers.
    No other settings are affected.


      PARAMS:
      RETURN:
